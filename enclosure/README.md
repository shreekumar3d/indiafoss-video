# Enclosure

The video streaming hardware right now consists of two PiBox VC-304-D
USB 3.0 capture devices.  Each is capable of streaming 1080p@60 Hz,
YUYV2 format.  One is used for video (speaker) and the other is used
for slides (presentation).

The enclosure gives a nice feel and improves the usability of the
cards.  Primary purpose would be to clearly show users where to
connect video and slides sources.  The placement of the text also
serves to indicate the HDMI ports to connect the input sources.
HDMI IN and OUT of both capture cards are shown by arrows on top.

The capture cards have an LED. This turns ON when the cards is
active. Both LEDs are in line. This is marked by label "LIVE"
on the enclosure, which signals intent.

Modelled in FreeCAD. Uses the inter font for labels.  Prints have a
really nice solid feel in the hand (thick walls).  Two tone prints
based on Z height could be nice.  White and green is an obvious
choice. Height roughly 30 mm, 30% of the dimension.

Two M3x40 screws+nuts hold the capture cards in place. The head
protrudes out a bit. One is probably enough, but may look weird.
The other hole could be used to secure it to some place, etc if
required. Not designed for that, though.

## Possible Improvements

There is some gap between the M3 screws and the capture cards.
Should be fixed for snug fit. Cards don't move much due to
considerable friction though, but inserting HDMI exerts significant
force and they may move by a fraction of an mm or so ?

Perhaps build a "face" with a HDMI port cutout and LED masked.
When the LED lights up, the light would shine through plastic
and indicate status.
